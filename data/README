### OVERVIEW ###

This dataset contains sentences that were extracted from the revision histories
of www.wikiHow.com articles. There are two subsets: (a) sentences from the
revision history that later received edits which made the sentence more precise
and (b) sentences that remained unchanged over multiple revisions of the article.

Last update: 5 March 2021 (added revisions and types to training data)

### DATA ###

The dataset is split into training, development and test, following the split by
article from the original wikiHowToImprove release [1]. Sentences labelled as
"requires revision" were extracted using a rule-based approach that compared
each sentence with edited versions later in the revision history. The following
revision types are part of this labeled set of sentences:

 * Replacements of pronouns with more precise noun phrases (REPLACED_PRONOUN)
 * Replacements of 'do' as a full verb with more precise verbs (REPLACED_DO)
 * Insertions of optional verbal phrase complements (ADDED_ARG)
 * Insertions of adverbial and adjectival modifiers (ADDED_MOD)
 * Insertions of logical quantifiers and modal verbs (ADDED_QUANT and ADDED_MOD)

In addition to sentences that "require" revision (according to the revision
history), the data contains sentences that remained unrevised over multiple
versions of the article and that are also part of its final version.

### FORMAT ###

The data is provided in a tab-separated format (.tsv) with the following columns:

 1. Filename of the article (revision history)
 2. Line number in the revision history
 3. Sentence label ("REQ_REVISION" or "KEEP_UNREVIS")
 4. Tokenized sentence
 5. Sentence context (full line from revision history)
 6. Type of revision, if applicable (training set only)
 7. Revised sentence, if applicable (training set only)

In wikiHow and other resources, such instructions are subject to revision edits on a regular basis. Do these edits improve instructions only in terms of style and correctness, or do they provide clarifications necessary to follow the instructions and to accomplish the goal? We describe a resource and first studies towards answering this question. Specifically, we create wikiHowToImprove, a collection of revision histories for about 2.7 million sentences from about 246000 wikiHow articles. We describe human annotation studies on categorizing a subset of sentence-level edits and provide baseline models for the task of automatically distinguishing {``}older{''} from {``}newer{''} revisions of a sentence.",
